    "- LLM Operator needs to be installed. Please visit\n",
    "  the [documentation site](https://llm-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for the installation procedure.\n",
    "- This notebook uses the [OpenAI Python library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python). Please run\n",
    "  `pip install openai` to install it.\n",
    "- This notebook requires an API key. Please run `llmo auth login` and `llmo auth api-keys create --name <Name>` to create an API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up a Client\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to create an `OpenAI` client. You need to set `base_url` and `api_key`\n",
    "based on your configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of `base_url` points to the address of the LLM Operator API endpoint.\n",
    "For example, the `base_rul` is set to `http://localhost:8080/v1` if you're accessing\n",
    "the endpoint running at your localhost with port 8080."
